# Abstract Algebra Class

Welcome to my GaTech Math 4107 Abstract Algebra Repository! These are notes for people who might have missed lectures and reviews. 


## Course Overview

Abstract Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields. This course will cover fundamental concepts, theorems, and applications within these structures.

### Topics Covered and Corresponding lectures 
(note: the titles for the LaTex pdfs are not very reliable as I forgot to change them (like at least 5 lectures are titled "Cosets" but they arent about cosets..), so please refer to the list below)

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by date, with each date containing lecture notes and related metadata. Homeworks numbers should be calculated by subtracting 1 i.e. if the file is under hw2 -> then its actually the third homework.
